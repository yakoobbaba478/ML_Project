about
=====
Build a recommondation system based on deep learning techinques.A system which accepts images of apperels,
classify the apparel type and do a feature vector search to recommond similar type apparels.
Dataset is created by scraping several websites(non-commercial use)
and applied some augmentations to the dataset to increase the size of the data.
Had a VVG16 classifier to classify apparel type(ex. shirt,trouser,etc.).
Recommond related apparels from same class by feature vector search over available apparel list.
